                    <p> Our products range from our well known Horchata latte’s to our fresh baked conchas made
                        daily

                        Our
                        pastries and desserts come from long traditions held by our ancestors who would use
                        antiquated
                        methods
                        in
                        wood
                        burning ovens. We continued these traditions by using similar methods and adding a modern
                        spin
                        to
                        very
                        popular
                        drinks such as the Nayarit espresso. Nayarit coffee beans brought from a small pueblo in
                        Nayarit
                        Mexico
                        made
                        from scratch and delivered to us to you in a blended espresso beverage, hot or cold in
                        preference. You can refer to our menu <a href="menu.html">here.</a>
